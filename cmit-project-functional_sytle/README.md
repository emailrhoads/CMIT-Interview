1. CMIT uses functional programming a lot. You can read about it online. Essentially, it means that we try to avoid side effects on objects (e.g. array.push.) So, you end up writing "map" a lot, instead of "each". See if you can review the code and see how functional programming can be applied. There's a lot of online resources on functional programming.
2. Review the online ruby code style guides. The following seems good: https://github.com/github/rubocop-github/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md
3. It would be better to avoid hard-coded values. Consider how the code would work without the hard-codes.
